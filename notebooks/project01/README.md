### Introduction
---

The objective of the project is to apply statistical methods to uncover evolution of beak morphology. Some of the methods used include:
- Permutation Tests;
- Bootstrapping;


### The data
---

[Peter and Rosemary Grant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_and_Rosemary_Grant) measured during the past 40 years the beak morphology for 2 species of finch birds ( Geospiza fortis and Geospiza scandens) present in the the Galápagos island of Daphne Major.

The subset of the original dataset used in this notebook was curated and made avaiable by DataCamp staff as part of this project.

The original data set can be found [here](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/evolution/library/01/6/l_016_01.html).


### The Code
---

A) Run the code a local machine:

  Download or clone this repository using git on bash:

    git clone https://github.com/joseferncruz/datascience_projects.git

  Install a python environment with jupyter notebooks/lab such as the [anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual). In order to create an environment with all the required packages, open the annaconda powershell type:

    conda env create -f ds_project01_environment.yml


B) Run the code on an online executable environment:

  Load the notebooks on google colaboratory:

  Create a google colaboratory account;
  From an google colab environment, select file > open notebook > github and paste the link to this repository.
