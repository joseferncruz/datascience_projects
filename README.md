## Introduction

This repository will hold all the small data science projects that I do to train myself in different areas of data science. Some of them will be associated with specific online courses, others may arise from areas of personal interest.

The main global is to work on projects in which I am responsible for coding the analysis and extract insights from the data while becoming proficient in advanced statistical methods.

## Repository contents

In the folder `projects/` you can find the individual projects and associated notebooks used for exploratory data analysis and modeling. you will also find a README file with specific information associated with the project and a `environment.yml` that can be used to generate a conda environment.


## Projects


So far you can find the following projects:

- `notebooks/project01/`
    - __P-01 | Inheritance of beak morphology in the Galapagos finches__ [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/joseferncruz/datascience_projects.git/master)
